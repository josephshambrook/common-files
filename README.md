# Common Files

> Inspired by [Spotify Web Scripts](https://github.com/spotify/web-scripts)

This is a repo of common files I usually create across multiple different projects, tailored to my own tastes/opinions. This also serves as a reminder of what kind of files I need to add to a repo.

## Packages covered/to be added

- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] ESLint
- [ ] Prettier
- [ ] Next.js

## Quick Notes

- I prefer my config files to be as individual JS files, so that
  - they're separated from other configs
  - I can add comments
